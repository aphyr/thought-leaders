# Thought Leaders

The internet is full of **Thought Leaders**. They exist everywhere - tweeting, blogging, sometimes even appearing in person - always leading with their thoughts. 

No one, to my knowledge, has assembled the authoritative list of internet thought leaders (known to us on the inside as "TLs"; other acceptable terms are **Key Opinion Leaders** and **Luminaries**.) It is my hope that this will be a living list of such individuals. 

### How To Contribute A Thought Leader

Fork this repo and send a pull request. Myself and/or other approved TLs will review submissions. Additionally, you can add areas of expertise to existing thought leaders that may have been overlooked.
